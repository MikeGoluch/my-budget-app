# my-budget-app

The idea for the app came from the Udemy course "The Complete JavaScript Course 2020: Build Real Projects!" created by Jonas Schmedtmann.
The application provides possibility to calculate Your budget. It has also embedded the functionality to store the data in localStorage, so You won't lose the budget progress even if You close the browser.
